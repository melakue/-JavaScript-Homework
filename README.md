Analyize UFO Sighting data and create a table dynamically based upon the dataset. Allow users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, appends a table to web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Use a date form in HTML document and have JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

* Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, have JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  * date/time
  * city
  * state
  * country
  * shape
